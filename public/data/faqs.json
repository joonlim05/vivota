    "question": "How is Vivota different from other tuition centres?",
    "answer": "Unlike many other tuition centres that overload students with verbose notes, excessive homework or irrelevant/outdated content, Vivota focuses on identifying each student’s learning gaps and teaching in an exam-oriented manner, supported by personalized mentorship and our structured 14-day learning plans. Through this approach, students can study smarter, avoid wasted effort, and improve their results much faster."

    "question": "What if the student is unable to make it for the lesson due to last minute commitments?",
    "answer": "For subjects with 2 sessions a week, the student may opt to attend the other session. If that is not possible, fret not — the student may also join us on Zoom for lesson, and inform the tutor to record that session so that they can replay the lesson in the comfort of their own home."
